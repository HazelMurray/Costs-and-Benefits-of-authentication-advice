# Costs-and-Benefits-of-authentication-advice 


This repository contains supplementary material related to the ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security publication "Costs and Benefits of Authentication Advice". 

The repository contains the following documents:

- Authentication advice collection
This document lists each piece of advice that was collected for our study of the Costs and Benefits of Authentication Advice. 
It illustrates which pieces of advice were contained under each category and advice statement.

- Authentication advice discussion
In this document, we discuss the authentication advice that was collected as part of our study of the Costs and Benefits of Authentication Advice. 
We refer to interesting characteristics within the advice we collected, context in relation to how advice can be implemented and make connections to relevant academic literature. We also refer to some interesting comments we received from users and administrators who were part of
the user study carried out as part of this work. 

- Benefits of Authentication Advice
This document contains the rationale for how the security benefits were assigned to each advice statement.

- Costs of Authentication Advice
This document contains a description of the costs associated with each advice category and statement. 
The costs correspond to those indicated by users and administrators in our user study. For each category, we provide further impressions, characteristics, and notable respondent comments.

- User survey responses
This folder contains all the responses we received from both end-users and administrators as part of the user study. 

- Costs versus benefits data
To analyse costs versus benefits we assigned an ordinal scaling to costs and benefits and plotted this for each piece of advice on a graph. 
This allows us to visualise how benefits compare to costs. However, the graph is too crowded to show all the advice as most of it falls in the centre of the graph. Therefore, here we provide the raw data or a more detailed perusal.
